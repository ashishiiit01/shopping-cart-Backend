# shopping-cart-Backend
This is a basic e-commerce site.You have to clone the frontend code also from shopping-cart-frontend. The important thing is the payment integration.Allthough the payment methods are all in test mode. I have given users three payment options to pay i.e.via Paypal, via Paytm and via masterCard. For the master card, I have used stripe Api.
